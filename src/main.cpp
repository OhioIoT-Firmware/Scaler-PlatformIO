// TODO: Device ID randomness. _create_code() uses random(36) with no randomSeed(). On the ESP32 Arduino core random() is backed by the hardware RNG (esp_random()), so this is almost certainly fine — but given that a collision in an 8-char ID would be catastrophic in a multi-tenant system, it's worth a one-line confirmation that your core version routes random() to the HW RNG and not a deterministic newlib PRNG. If you ever have doubt, seed from esp_random() explicitly before the loo

// TODO: events.increment() writes NVS on every wifi retry. wifi_retries increments each time reconnect() fires, which is every RECONNECT_INTERVAL (10 s) while offline — and each increment is a putUInt. A device stuck offline overnight writes the same key thousands of times. NVS has wear leveling, but this is the kind of thing that quietly kills flash on a long-deployed fleet. Consider accumulating retries/drops in RAM and flushing to NVS only on a clean reconnect (or on a timer), rather than on every attempt.

// TODO:  do we need to lock the partition scheme as well?
